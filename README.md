# COGNIFLOW: The AI-Powered Knowledge Graph and Development Studio

**COGNIFLOW** is a cutting-edge application designed to help developers and researchers organize their thoughts, code snippets, and research findings into an interconnected, AI-enhanced knowledge graph. It combines a powerful note-taking interface with a dedicated development studio and utilizes large language models (LLMs) for intelligent analysis, connection discovery, and code assistance.

Now available as an **NPM package**: [`@chieji/cogniflow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chieji/cogniflow)

## Key Features

| Feature | Description | AI Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Visualize and explore the semantic connections between your notes, code, and ideas. | Automatically discovers and suggests new connections between notes. |
| **Dev Studio** | A dedicated environment for writing, testing, and managing code snippets with syntax highlighting and version control. | Provides code completion, debugging assistance, and code diff analysis. |
| **AI Chat & Tools** | Interact with a conversational AI to summarize notes, generate tags, and perform complex data analysis. | Uses Gemini and Hugging Face models for various cognitive tasks. |
| **Multimodal Analysis** | Analyze visual media (images) and generate speech from text directly within the application. | Leverages Gemini's multimodal capabilities. |

## Installation

### As an NPM Package
```bash
npm install @chieji/cogniflow
```

### For Development

#### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

#### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chieji/COGNIFLOW.git
    cd COGNIFLOW
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key:**
    The application requires a **Gemini API Key** for its core AI functionalities. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your key:
    ```
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Build the library:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    Outputs optimized ES and UMD bundles to the `dist/` directory.
